# 01 - Executive Summary

> Part of [StockDataManager Blueprint](./00_index.md)

---

## 🌟 TL;DR

StockDataManager is a unified pipeline for downloading stock data from multiple sources (yfinance, Alpha Vantage), preprocessing it with configurable indicators, and visualizing results through a web interface.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Currently, working with stock data requires:
- Writing boilerplate for each data source
- Handling inconsistent data formats
- Manually calculating indicators
- Building one-off visualization scripts

This wastes time and leads to bugs from copy-pasted code.

## ❌ Non-Goals (Explicit Exclusions)

| Non-Goal | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Real-time streaming data | Focus on batch/historical first |
| Trading execution | This is data pipeline, not trading bot |
| Mobile app | Web interface is sufficient |
| Multi-user authentication | Single-user tool |

---

## ✅ Features Overview

| Priority | Feature | Difficulty | Description |

## 📊 Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Download time (100 tickers) | < 60 seconds | Timer in CLI |
| Data completeness | > 99% | Count NaN values |
| Indicator accuracy | Match TradingView | Manual comparison |

---

## 📅 Scope Budget

| Phase | Duration | Hard Limit |
|-------|----------|------------|
| P0 (Walking Skeleton) | 3 days | Download + basic preprocess |
| P1 (Foundation) | 1 week | Indicators + web viz |
| P2 (Polish) | 1 week | Additional sources |

## 🛠️ Tech Preferences

| Category | Preference | Rationale |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Language | Python 3.11+ | Existing ecosystem |
| Data Library | pandas | Standard for finance |
| Web Framework | Flask | Simple, sufficient |
| Charting | Plotly | Interactive, no JS needed |

## ❓ Open Questions

- Should we cache downloaded data? (Probably yes, TBD on strategy)
- How to handle API rate limits?
