REQUIRED: Visual, scannable narrative — NOT a text wall.
Use ASCII boxes, tables, and emoji anchors. A PM should grasp the problem/solution in 10 seconds.
If you can't draw the pain and vision, you don't understand the feature.

OPTIONAL SECTION: 🔬 Deep Dive

⚠️  DEEP DIVE vs FREE ZONE — KNOW THE DIFFERENCE:

    FREE ZONE is for CONCEPTUAL thinking:
    - Philosophical tensions, metaphors, assumptions
    - Strategic decisions, scope fences, future regrets
    - Things you'd explain in a meeting

    DEEP DIVE is for RIGOROUS TECHNICAL ARTIFACTS:
    - UML diagrams (class, sequence, state machine) in Mermaid
    - Mathematical proofs with complexity analysis (Big-O, LaTeX)
    - Benchmark tables with actual measured numbers
    - Weighted trade-off matrices with scoring formulas
    - Migration timelines (Gantt charts)
    - Data schema evolution (v1 → v2 → v3 with column maps)
    - Folder structure diagrams with file responsibilities
    - Dependency graphs showing module relationships
    - Circuit breaker configurations, rollback strategies
    - Error propagation analysis with failure modes
    - Things you'd draw on a WHITEBOARD with precision

WHEN TO USE DEEP DIVE:
- Algorithm choices need Big-O analysis, benchmarks, or correctness proofs
- Architecture requires class diagrams showing ≥5 classes with relationships
- Migration needs phased timeline with rollback triggers
- Performance requires actual measured numbers, not estimates
- Multiple implementations compared with weighted scoring matrix
- State machines have ≥4 states with complex transitions
- API evolution spans ≥2 versions with schema changes

WHEN TO DELETE (use FREE ZONE or Technical Notes instead):
- Feature is straightforward with no algorithmic complexity
- A simple table or bullet list captures the tradeoffs
- No need for diagrams, proofs, or benchmarks
- Implementation path is obvious from Overview + Technical Notes

EXPECTED DEPTH: 60-280 lines per Deep Dive section
If your Deep Dive is <40 lines, it probably belongs in Technical Notes or FREE ZONE.

If you keep this section, remove these comments and fill in relevant subsections.
If you delete this section, also remove it from the FIXED SECTIONS comment at bottom.

## 🔬 Deep Dive

<!-- 
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
This section is for RIGOROUS TECHNICAL ARTIFACTS that require precision.
These are NOT conceptual discussions — they are engineering documentation.

⚠️  CODE EXAMPLES WARNING ⚠️
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Code blocks in this section are CONCEPTUAL ILLUSTRATIONS, not implementation specs.

❌ DO NOT take code examples literally
❌ DO NOT copy-paste into production
❌ DO NOT assume exact function signatures, types, or patterns

✅ Use code blocks ONLY for:
   • Logic showcase: "The core idea is roughly: if X then Y"
   • Simple examples: Demonstrating a concept in 5-10 lines
   • API sketches: Showing intended developer experience (DX)

✅ Code should communicate INTENT, not IMPLEMENTATION

If you need precise specs, use:
   • API Contract section (with versioning)
   • OpenAPI/JSON Schema references
   • Link to actual source files
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🎯 LITMUS TEST: "Would this require a whiteboard with diagrams and numbers?"
   If yes → Deep Dive is warranted. If just discussion → use FREE ZONE.

⚠️  MINIMUM DEPTH: 60 lines. If you can express it in <40 lines, 
    it belongs in Technical Notes or FREE ZONE.

📂 EXAMPLE FILES (see templates/examples/):

  COMPREHENSIVE ARCHITECTURE (80-120 lines):
  • deep_dive_comprehensive_architecture.example.md
    - Class diagrams (Mermaid) showing ≥5 classes with relationships
    - Sequence diagrams for complex multi-step flows
    - Folder structure with file responsibilities table
    - Dependency graphs (internal + external)
    - Capacity planning calculations with actual numbers

  MIGRATION STRATEGY (80-120 lines):
  • deep_dive_migration_strategy.example.md
    - Gantt timeline with phases and milestones
    - Before/After state diagrams
    - Data schema evolution (v1 → v2 with column mappings)
    - Rollback strategy with trigger conditions
    - Risk matrix with probability × impact scoring

  ALGORITHM ANALYSIS (60-100 lines):
  • deep_dive_algorithm_proof.example.md
    - Complexity proofs with Big-O and LaTeX formulas
    - Benchmark tables with measured numbers (not estimates)
    - Weighted trade-off matrix with scoring formula
    - Decision tree for algorithm selection
    - Edge case table with failure modes and mitigations

  • deep_dive_algorithm_choices.example.md — Algorithm comparison + benchmarks
  • deep_dive_api_contract.example.md — API spec with schemas + versioning
  • deep_dive_error_handling.example.md — Error taxonomy + recovery strategies

|----------|------|-------|------|------|---------|
| {Option A} | O(?) | O(?) | {pros} | {cons} | ✅ Selected |
| {Option B} | O(?) | O(?) | {pros} | {cons} | ❌ Rejected |

### API Contract Draft

```python
def {function_name}({params}: {types}) -> {ReturnType}:
    """Brief description."""
    ...
```

### Sequence Diagram

<!-- Flow of control for primary use case -->

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant F as This Feature
    participant D as Dependency
    
    U->>F: {action}
    F->>D: {call}
    D-->>F: {response}
    F-->>U: {result}
```

### Performance Tradeoffs

<!-- Conscious tradeoffs with rationale -->

| Tradeoff | We chose... | Because... | Risk |
|----------|-------------|------------|------|
| {Memory vs Speed} | {choice} | {rationale} | {what could go wrong} |

### Error Handling Strategy

<!-- Failure modes, detection, response, user impact -->

| Failure Mode | Detection | Response | User Impact |
|--------------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| {What can fail} | {How we detect it} | {What we do} | {What user sees} |
