# Agent Definition Authoring Guidelines

## Goals
- Create specialized AI personas ("Agents") with distinct roles and boundaries.
- Ensure agents are self-aware, strictly adherent to rules, and efficient in execution.
- Standardize the structure of `.agent.md` files for consistent behavior switching.
- NOTE: Do not repeat rules in <stopping_rules>, <core_philosophy>, and <critical_rules> sections, put the information in the MOST appropriate section only.

## Required Section Order
Each agent definition file MUST include sections in this logical flow:
1) **YAML Header**: Frontmatter with description, name, tools, etc.
2) **Mode Instructions Block**: The `<modeInstructions>` XML tag wrapping the entire content.
3) **Role Definition**: A clear statement of who the agent is.
4) **Directives**: High-level goals and scope.
5) **Stopping Rules**: `<stopping_rules>` tag.
6) **Core Philosophy**: `<core_philosophy>` tag.
7) **Workflow**: `<workflow>` tag.
8) **Critical Rules**: `<critical_rules>` tag.

## Template
Copy and adapt this template for any new agent file.

```markdown

description: <Short Description>
name: <AgentName>
# tools: [] # TODO: User, please add available tools here (e.g., 'edit', 'search'). Type '#' in chat to see available tools.
